Functionality TODO (wish) list  
==============================

	*	Improved config file and arguments usage for daemons
		(also --help and possibly a man page)

	*	Usage of a node's (Ganglia) location in the ClusterImage
		construction (placement by x,y,z coordinates)
  
	*	More advanced and detailed graph's, etc

	*	Usage of regexp's or wildcards at jobsearch
		i.e. for job name/user/queue

	*	Ability to search by certain node properties
		instead of job properties. I.e.: a certain node
		hostname and/or number of nodes/cpus
