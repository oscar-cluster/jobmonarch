DESCRIPTION
===========

	Job Monarch is a set of tools to monitor and optionally archive (batch)job information.

	It is a addon for the Ganglia monitoring system and plugs in to a existing Ganglia setup.

	To view a operational setup with Job Monarch, have a look here: http://ganglia.sara.nl/


	Job Monarch stands for 'Job Monitoring and Archiving' tool and consists of three (3) components:

	* jobmond

		The Job Monitoring Daemon.
		  
		Gathers PBS/Torque batch statistics on jobs/nodes and submits them into
		Ganglia's XML stream.

		Through this daemon, users are able to view the PBS/Torque batch system and the
		jobs/nodes that are in it (be it either running or queued).

	* jobarchived

		The Job Archiving Daemon (optionally).

		Listens to Ganglia's XML stream and archives the job and node statistics.
		It stores the job statistics in a Postgres SQL database and the node statistics
		in RRD files.
		
		Through this daemon, users are able to lookup a old/finished job
		and view all it's statistics.

		Optionally: You can either choose to use this daemon if your users have use for it.
		As it can be a heavy application to run - even though optimized (staged/buffered writes
		and multi threaded) - and not everyone may have a need for it.
		
	* web

		The Job Monarch web interface.

		This interfaces with the jobmond data and (optionally) the jobarchived and presents the
		data and graphs.

		It does this in a similar layout/setup as Ganglia itself, so the navigation and usage is intuitive.

START
=====

	* jobmond

		The Job Monitor has to be run on a machine that is allowed to

		Make sure that if you have 'acl_hosts' enabled on your PBS/Torque
		server that jobmond's machine is in it.

		1. Start the Job Monitor:

		 > /usr/local/sbin/jobmond.py -c /etc/jobmond.conf

	* jobarchived

		1. Start the Job Archiver:

		 > /usr/local/sbin/jobarchived.py -c /etc/jobarchived.conf

	* web

		Doesn't require you to (re)start anything.
		( make sure the Postgres database is running though )
