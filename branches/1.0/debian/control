Description: Job MonArch's Web Frontend
 Job-Monarch is a set of tools to monitor and optionally archive (batch) job
 information. It is a addon for the Ganglia monitoring system and plugs into an
 existing Ganglia setup.
 The Job Monarch web frontend interfaces with the
 jobmond data and (optionally) the jobarchived and presents the data and
 graphs. It does this in a similar layout/setup as Ganglia itself, so the
 navigation and usage is intuitive.
