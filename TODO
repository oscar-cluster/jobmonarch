Features on the horizon:
------------------------

* Config file and arguments usage for daemons
  (also --help and possibly a man page)

* Actual version reporting by daemons

* 'queued since' reporting of jobs

* Clickable nodes in the "big" cluster image,
  filtering all jobs on that particular node.

* Mouse hints on the "big" cluster image,
  showing node information detail when holding
  over a node. Information such as jobid(s),
  queues, users, etc

* Usage of a node's location in the ClusterImage
  construction (placement by x,y,z coordinates)

* Usage of regexp's or wildcards at jobsearch
  i.e. for job name/user/queue

* Ability to search by certain node properties
  instead of job properties. I.e.: a certain node
  hostname and/or number of nodes/cpus
